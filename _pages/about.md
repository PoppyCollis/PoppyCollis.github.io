I am a PhD student at the University of Sussex working in the [IM2 lab](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of Chris Buckley and Anil Seth. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersection between computational neuroscience and machine learning. I study methods which use variational Bayesian inference to model intelligent decision-making in cognitive agents. My PhD research is funded by UKRI Horizon Europe as part of the [MetaTool](https://www.metatool-project.eu/){:target="_blank"} project led by the Universidad Polit√©cnica De Madrid, which aims to develop a computational model of tool innovation in artificial systems.
