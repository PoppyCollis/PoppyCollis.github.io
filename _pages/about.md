I am a PhD student at the University of Sussex working in the [ICAM lab](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/) under the supervision of Prof. Chris Buckley. My research interests revolve around methods which use approximate Bayesian inference to describe intelligent decision-making in cognitive agents. I am particularly interested in developing adaptive systems capable of compositional generalisation in different task environments. I am funded by UKRI Horizon Europe as part of the [MetaTool](https://www.metatool-project.eu/) project led by the Universidad Polit√©cnica De Madrid, which aims to develop a computational model of tool invention in autonomous robotic systems.
