Module description 
======

This module looks what it means for an animal or a machine to behave intelligently, and how brain and behavioural systems are adapted to enable an animal to cope effectively within its environment. It considers diverse aspects of intelligence including navigation and motor control, tool-use, language, memory and social skills. The course asks how these are related to one another and how they are matched to the particular needs of animals and machines.

The lab sessions involve working through guided modelling tasks on:
- Braitenburg's vehicles
- Elementary motion detection
- Monte Carlo simulations of collective behaviour.
